# java-kmeans-clustering
This is a simple way of implementing KMeans Clustering I wrote from scratch, my PhD. lecturer couldn't understand it so didn't appreciate what I did. I hope it gets into good hands and would be happy if you make changes to it.

# Documentations will be added soon.

* The src directory conatins both Main and Input2D classes.
* The data is provided in the main class manually for now and will change that soon.
